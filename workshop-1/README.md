## Final submission - Grade 2

After getting the peer reviews, decided to remove the association from Municipality, but keep it in the domain as it was a requirement and the municipality is an important part in the domain. We also keep the Authentication in the domain. In the real world it could simply be a door that requires a key.

We also removed the association between the Calendar and Booking, as that relationship does not need to persist. The Booking object remembers the booked boats and berths itself.
